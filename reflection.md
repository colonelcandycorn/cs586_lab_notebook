## Reflection Document

### HTML

I feel much more confident in my understanding of the various html elements
and how they interact with each other. I've also gained a much better
appreciation for each element's semantic meaning.

### Accessibility

Accessibility is something I was vaguely aware of before, but I didn't
really know how to approach it. I feel comfortable with forms, tables, and
pretty basic ideas. I do find myself getting confused when attempting to
create more complex elements like cards or modals.

### CSS

CSS is a lot more fun than just HTML. I don't really have any particularly
strong design skills, but I did enjoy looking at an image and trying to
recreate it with CSS.

### Flexbox

Flexbox really just makes things work in a way that the classic box model
doesn't for me. It can be a little overwhelming with memorizing all the
different spacing properties. I found the browser dev tools to be very
helpful in visualizing the different flexbox properties.

### Grid

Grid seems like what I would use for any website layout. It's very easy
to visualize and understand. I think it works very well in conjunction
with flexbox.

### Bootstrap

Frameworks seem like a good way to get websites off the ground without
getting too bogged down in the details. I think I would like to learn
more about bootstrap by using it in a project alongside what we have
learned about javascript.

### JavaScript

I really enjoy the functional aspects of javascript, and I find javascript
as a language to be very straightforward. I'd heard of promises before, but
after messing around with fetch, I feel like I have a much better
understanding of how they work. The one area where I find javascript messy
is in the DOM. It's given me a better appreciation for why jQuery was so
popular, and why frameworks like React are so popular now.

### jQuery

It's a definite improvement over vanilla javascript for manipulating the
DOM but still feels awkward to use. The parenthesis/curly brace/dollar sign
syntax is not nice to look at, hard to read, and easy to mess up. I kept getting
errors because I'd forget a dollar sign or put a parenthesis in the wrong place.
